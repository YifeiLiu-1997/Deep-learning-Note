- like TV, 5 nobe equals to tune width, height, angle, color, left and right.

## single number evalution metric
- classifier A and B have precision and recall, how to compare these two classifier.
- F1 score = (2 / (1/P) + (1/R)) (harmonic function)

## satisificting and optimizing metrics
- Accuracy Running time, you can set a threshold like runnint time < 100ms and choose best accuracy.
- trigger words (ok googlem, hey siri)


## avoidable bias
