# Welcome

- Course one: learn how to build a **Neural Network** and how to train them on data. 
*(2 ~ 4 weeks)*
> you will recognize a cat with **Deep Neural Network** in the end of this course
---

- Course two: learn narrowly neural network how to get it perform well. 
*(3 weeks)*
> hyperparameter tuning, regularization, diagnose bias and variance, 
 advanced optimization algorithms like **Momentum** and **Adam** algorithm
---

- Course three: learn how to struct your machine learning project.
*(3 weeks)*
> change the error of deep learning, end-to-end deep learning
---

- Course four: learn Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
*(1 weeks)*
> how to build it
---

- Course five: sequence models.
*(2 weeks)*
> how to apply them to nature language processing (RNNs, LSTM)
